# Usage:

## Instalation:
In the meantime, this software is API only. If you have JS and HTML skills, a demo page would really be appreciated!

To initiate the API server, you need to first install TensorRT and it's dependencies. I have made a small shell script to install most of the requirements, but it's not bulletproof:

```
# install python3.10 and create a venv
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-dev -y

# create and enable the venv
python3.10 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

# Install system TensorRT
sudo apt install tensorrt tensorrt-dev tensorrt-devel tensorrt-libs -y

# Clone the TensorRT repo
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT
cd TensorRT
git submodule update --init --recursive

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade tensorrt

export TRT_OSSPATH=$PWD

cd $TRT_OSSPATH
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DTRT_OUT_DIR=$PWD/out
cd plugin
make -j$(nproc)

export PLUGIN_LIBS="$TRT_OSSPATH/build/out/libnvinfer_plugin.so"

cd $TRT_OSSPATH/demo/Diffusion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you should have the dependencies and plugin compiled. I highly recommend running `echo $PLUGIN_LIBS` and save the output somewhere, as this is the compiled plugin needed for tensorRT inference

now go back to the SDA-Node repo or clone it if you haven't.

```
git clone https://github.com/chavinlo/sda-node
cd sda-node
```

now just install your python server of choice and start the server:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install gunicorn
LD_PRELOAD=${PLUGIN_LIBS} gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
```

It is EXTREMELY important that you run it with `LD_PRELOAD=${PLUGIN_LIBS}` to use the needed plugins.

## Inference

By default, it will use the configuration file on cfg/basic.json

just change "model_path" to the folder where your .plan files are available.

For example, if I want to use Anything-V3: https://huggingface.co/tensorrt/Anything-V3

First, clone the HuggingFace Repo:
```
# Install git-lfs first
sudo apt install git-lfs
git lfs install

git clone https://huggingface.co/tensorrt/Anything-V3
```

You can also download each file manually on the engine/ folder, just place them back in one folder again.

Then, go to basic.json and edit the following line:
`"model_path": "/workspace/TensorRT/demo/Diffusion/Anything-V3/engine",`
Into:
`"model_path": "anything-v3/engine",`
It must be changed to the path of where the *.plan files are at.

After this, just start the server again, and the API will be available at 127.0.0.1:5000, which you can use like below:

## Text2Image

Send a JSON request in the following format:
```
{
	"prompt": str,
	"negprompt": str,
	"width": int (min. 256, max. 1024),
	"height": int (min. 256, max. 1024),
	"steps": int (multiple of 5, min. 25, check config),
	"cfg": float,
	"seed": int (-1 for random),
	"scheduler": str,
	"mode": str,
	"lpw": bool
}
```

Where:

* prompt: is the prompt, but if you want to use weighting "()" or "[]" you have to enable LPW
* negative prompt: same as the prompt, but for things you want to avoid
* width: integer, minimun 256, maximun 1024. Large changes might generate a mismatch error, just try again
* height: same as width
* steps: Depends on the config, if using the default, make sure to use a multiple of 5, minimun 25
* cfg: float, how much text influences
* seed: integer, -1 for random seed
* scheduler: str, choose between EULER-A, LMSD, DPMS. DPMS and LMSD are accelerated, where as EULER-A is imported from diffusers (slower)
* lpw: bool, wether to enable Long and Extended Prompt module (where it will accept weighting) or to disable it (faster)
* mode: str, "file" to return a raw file download (instantly viewable), or "json" to return a json like the following:

Upon success:
```
{
    "status": "done",
    "content": {
        "img": image base64 encoded UTF-8,
        "time": time taken to process in seconds
    }
}
```

Upon failure:
```
{
    "status": "fail",
    "content": str with reason for failure
}
```
